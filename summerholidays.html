<h1>FIRST SUMMER HOLIDAY
</h1>
<br />
<p>Just two more days and the first summer holidays of the college would be over. Then again college, studies,projects ,more studies cycle would start.
<br />
<a href="http//:nitj.ac.in">NITJ</a>, the institute of national importance, My college. 
<br />
During the first year, I somehow enjoyed things, had fun, made a few memories, got to know about the college culture and a lot more.
But real college life starts now. I have to run against time to catch up with the modern world and create a name of respect in the society.
</p>

<h4>Lets talk of the what all i did in the summer holidays.
</h4>
<p>
Lets take them one by one
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These holidays didn't happen to be much fun. I didn't do anything much great. But yea, something i started new. I started writing on quora. I gave around quater a dozen answers. <br />
A few of them were really good( ...atleast i found them so :p), a few funny and yea, what else can be said about them. For more information , u may have to check my quora profile.
<br />

Secondly, i did <a href="newboston.com/cbasics">c programming</a> basics. Still i have got to learn a lot to become a good and efficient programmer. I will soon start other languages too.
</li>
<li>
Thirdly, i have read some really good books.Like 
<q> this is not my story - Savi Sharma</q>
or 
<q>I tooo had a love story</q>
<br />
I am currently reading 
<blockquote>
chanakyas chant</blockquote>
and plan to read a lot more good books. I have to read all the books in pdf mode as the college library sucks. It has not even got the literature section.
But no worries, <a href="google.co.in">GOOGLE</a>is always there to help.
